# Diner App

Diner App is an app made to help you choose a place to eat in your city. To use it, type the name of the city that you’re in, choose the type of food that you’d like to eat today and hit “Search”. You’ll be provided with three options displayed on a map and all the necessary information about the restaurants on the side bar.

The app gives you access to over 1.5 million restaurants across 10,000 cities globally.
